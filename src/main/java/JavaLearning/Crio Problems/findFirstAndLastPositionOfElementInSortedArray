Problem Description
Given an array of integers of length n sorted in ascending order and Q number of queries, 
for each query you have to find the first and last position (0-based indexed) of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

Input format
First line has an integer denoting the size of array (n)

Second line contains n space separated integers denoting the array(nums).

Third line contains an integer representing the value of Q.

In the next Q lines, each line will contain an integer K (target value).

Output format
Two integers representing the first and last position of the target value from the corresponding query given in the input.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 100000

-1000000000 <= nums[i] <= 1000000000

1 <= Q <= 50000

-1000000000 <= target <= 1000000000

Sample Input 1
5

1 2 2 3 4

3

1

2

5

Sample Output 1
0 0

1 2

-1 -1

Explanation 1
The first and last occurrence of 1 is at index 0, so returning 0 0. The first and last occurrence of 2 are at index 1 and 2. The target 5 is not found in the array, so returning -1 -1.
